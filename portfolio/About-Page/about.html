            Hi, I’m Menaga R., a passionate Software Developer with a keen
            interest in full-stack development and creating impactful solutions.
            My expertise lies in crafting clean, responsive web applications using
            technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Figma.
            I enjoy transforming innovative ideas into functional and user-friendly designs.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am also an avid learner, constantly exploring new tools and frameworks to enhance my skills. With
            a strong foundation in problem-solving and data structures, I’m driven to take on challenging
            projects that push me beyond my limits.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe
            in building solutions that are not only technically sound but also meaningful and impactful for users.
